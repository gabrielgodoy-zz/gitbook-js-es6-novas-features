interesting feature of Array.from is the second optional mapFunction argument. This allows you to create a new mapped array in a single invocation:\nlet navElements = document.querySelectorAll('nav li'),\n    navTitles = Array.from(navElements, el => el.textContent);\n\nArray.of\nThen, we have Array.of, which behaves much like the Array constructor.

Some believe that they go against the prototypal nature of JavaScript, while others think they lower the barrier to entry for beginners and people coming from other languages and that they help people writing large-scale applications. In any case, they are part of ES6. Here’s a very quick introduction.\nClasses are built around the class and constructor keywords\nclass Vehicle {\n    // Runs everytime a new instance is create with 'new'\n       constructor(name){ \n      this.name = name;\n      this.kind = 'vehicle';\n       }\n       getName() {\n      return this.name;\n       },\n       // Prefixing with underscore. Convention for private\n       _privateMethod() { \n      //...\n   }\n}\n\n// Create an instance\nlet myVehicle = new Vehicle('rocky');\n\nNote that the class definition is not a regular object. Hence, there are no commas between class members.\nThe constructor method is a special method for creating and intializing an object\nTo create an instance of a class, you must use the new keyword.\nlet myCar = new Car('bumpy');\n\nCreating a subclass\nTo inherit from a base class, use extends:\nclass Car extends Vehicle {\n   constructor(name) {\n      super(name);\n      this.kind = 'car'\n   }\n}\n\nlet myCar = new Car('bumpy');\nmyCar.getName(); // 'bumpy'\nmyCar instanceof Car; // true\n\nFrom the derived class, you can use super from any constructor or method to access its base class:\nTo call the parent constructor, use super()\nTo call another member, use, for example, super.getName()\nExample of subclass:\nclass Animal {\n    constructor(voice) {\n        this.voice = voice || 'grunt';\n    }\n    speak() {\n        display(this.voice);\n    }\n}\n\nclass Cat extends Animal {\n    constructor(name, color) {\n        super('Meow');\n        this.name = name;\n        this.color = color;\n    }\n}\n\nlet fluffy = new Cat('Fluffy', 'White');\ndisplay(Object.keys(fluffly.__proto__.__proto__)); // Array\ndisplay(fluffy.__proto__.__proto__.hasOwnProperty('speak')); // true\n\n"},"functions/":{"url":"functions/","title":"Functions","keywords":"","body":"Functions\n"},"functions/arrow-functions.html":{"url":"functions/arrow-functions.html","title":"Arrow Functions","keywords":"","body":"Arrow Functions\nArrow functions are always anonymous.\nThe this reference of an arrow function is the 'outer' this.

What remains is zero or more arguments, the “fat arrow” (=>) and the function expression. The return statement is implicitly added.\nWith zero or more than one argument, you must provide parentheses:\n// No arguments\nbooks.map( () => 1 ); // [1, 1]\n\n// Multiple arguments\n[1,2].map( (n, index) => n * index ); // [0, 2]\n\nPut the function expression in a block ({ ... }) if you need more logic or more white space:\nlet result = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map( n => {\n   n = n % 3;\n   return n;\n});\n\n"},"functions/default-parameters.html":{"url":"functions/default-parameters.html","title":"Default Parameters","keywords":"","body":"Default Parameters\nIn ES6, defining default values for function parameters is possible. \nThe syntax is as follows:\nfunction doSomething(x, y = 2) {\n   return x * y;\n}\n\n\ndoSomething(5); // 10\ndoSomething(5, undefined); // 10\ndoSomething(5, 3); // 15\n\n"},"functions/named-parameters.html":{"url":"functions/named-parameters.html","title":"Named Parameters","keywords":"","body":"Named Parameters\nUsing named parameters for optional settings makes it easier to understand how a function should be invoked.\nfunction setPageThread(name, { popular, expires, activeClass } = {}) {\n   // ...\n}\n\nand to call.

Instead, it is to be identified via its module’s name.\nNamed Exports (Several per module)\nA module can export multiple things by prefixing their declarations with the keyword export. These exports are distinguished by their names and are called named exports.\n//------ lib.js ------\nexport const sqrt = Math.sqrt;\nexport function square(x) {\n   return x * x;\n}\nexport function diag(x, y) {\n   return sqrt(square(x) + square(y));\n}\n\n//------ main.js ------\nimport { square, diag } from 'lib';\nconsole.log(square(11)); // 121\nconsole.log(diag(4, 3)); // 5\n\nThere are other ways to specify named exports (which are explained later), but I find this one quite convenient: simply write your code as if there were no outside world, then label everything that you want to export with a keyword.\nIf you want to, you can also import the whole module and refer to its named exports via property notation:\n//------ main.js ------\nimport * as lib from 'lib';\nconsole.log(lib.square(11)); // 121\nconsole.log(lib.diag(4, 3)); // 5\n\nExporting multiple function at once with curly braces\nYou can also store something in a variable then export it.
